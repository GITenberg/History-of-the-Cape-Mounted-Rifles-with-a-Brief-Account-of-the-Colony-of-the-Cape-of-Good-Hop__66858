<h2 class="nobreak lsp" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">The character and credit of the British Army must chiefly
depend upon the zeal and ardour, by which all who enter
into its service are animated, and consequently it is of the
highest importance that any measure calculated to excite the
spirit of emulation, by which alone great and gallant actions
are achieved, should be adopted.</p>

<p>Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment of
this desirable object, than a full display of the noble deeds
with which the Military History of our country abounds.
To hold forth these bright examples to the imitation of the
youthful soldier, and thus to incite him to emulate the
meritorious conduct of those who have preceded him in their
honourable career, are among the motives that have given
rise to the present publication.</p>

<p>The operations of the British Troops are, indeed, announced
in the “London Gazette,” from whence they are
transferred into the public prints: the achievements of our
armies are thus made known at the time of their occurrence,
and receive the tribute of praise and admiration to which
they are entitled. On extraordinary occasions, the Houses
of Parliament have been in the habit of conferring on the
Commanders, and the Officers and Troops acting under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
their orders, expressions of approbation and of thanks for
their skill and bravery, and these testimonials, confirmed by
the high honour of their Sovereign’s Approbation, constitute
the reward which the soldier most highly prizes.</p>

<p>It has not, however, until late years, been the practice
(which appears to have long prevailed in some of the Continental
armies) for British Regiments to keep regular
records of their services and achievements. Hence some
difficulty has been experienced in obtaining, particularly
from the old Regiments, an authentic account of their origin
and subsequent services.</p>

<p>This defect will now be remedied, in consequence of His
Majesty having been pleased to command, that every Regiment
shall in future keep a full and ample record of its
services at home and abroad.</p>

<p>From the materials thus collected, the country will
henceforth derive information as to the difficulties and
privations which chequer the career of those who embrace
the military profession. In Great Britain, where so large a
number of persons are devoted to the active concerns of
agriculture, manufactures, and commerce, and where these
pursuits have, for so long a period, been undisturbed by the
<em>presence of war</em>, which few other countries have escaped,
comparatively little is known of the vicissitudes of active
service, and of the casualties of climate, to which, even
during peace, the British Troops are exposed in every part
of the globe, with little or no interval of repose.</p>

<p>In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
country derives from the industry and the enterprise of the
agriculturist and the trader, its happy inhabitants may be
supposed not often to reflect on the perilous duties of the
soldier and the sailor,&mdash;on their sufferings,&mdash;and on the
sacrifice of valuable life, by which so many national benefits
are obtained and preserved.</p>

<p>The conduct of the British Troops, their valour, and
endurance, have shone conspicuously under great and trying
difficulties; and their character has been established in Continental
warfare by the irresistible spirit with which they
have effected debarkations in spite of the most formidable
opposition, and by the gallantry and steadiness with which
they have maintained their advantages against superior
numbers.</p>

<p>In the official Reports made by the respective Commanders,
ample justice has generally been done to the gallant
exertions of the Corps employed; but the details of their
services, and of acts of individual bravery, can only be fully
given in the Annals of the various Regiments.</p>

<p>These Records are now preparing for publication, under
His Majesty’s special authority, by Mr. <span class="smcap">Richard Cannon</span>,
Principal Clerk of the Adjutant-General’s Office; and while
the perusal of them cannot fail to be useful and interesting
to military men of every rank, it is considered that they will
also afford entertainment and information to the general
reader, particularly to those who may have served in the
Army, or who have relatives in the Service.</p>

<p>There exists in the breasts of most of those who have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
served, or are serving, in the Army, an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esprit du Corps</i>&mdash;an
attachment to every thing belonging to their Regiment;
to such persons a narrative of the services of their own Corps
cannot fail to prove interesting. Authentic accounts of the
actions of the great,&mdash;the valiant,&mdash;the loyal, have always
been of paramount interest with a brave and civilized people.
Great Britain has produced a race of heroes who, in moments
of danger and terror, have stood, “firm as the rocks
of their native shore;” and when half the World has been
arrayed against them, they have fought the battles of their
Country with unshaken fortitude. It is presumed that a
record of achievements in war,&mdash;victories so complete and
surprising, gained by our countrymen,&mdash;our brothers,&mdash;our
fellow-citizens in arms,&mdash;a record which revives the memory
of the brave, and brings their gallant deeds before us, will
certainly prove acceptable to the public.</p>

<p>Biographical memoirs of the Colonels and other distinguished
Officers, will be introduced in the Records of their
respective Regiments, and the Honorary Distinctions which
have, from time to time, been conferred upon each Regiment,
as testifying the value and importance of its services,
will be faithfully set forth.</p>

<p>As a convenient mode of Publication, the Record of each
Regiment will be printed in a distinct number, so that when
the whole shall be completed, the Parts may be bound up
in numerical succession.</p>

<p class="noindent">The spirit of enterprise which led intelligent
Europeans to penetrate to every part of the
globe, and to procure the advantage of the productions
of every climate for the use of their own
country, has multiplied the commerce of the
world, and added numerous colonial possessions
to the nations of Christendom. Among the
enterprising navigators of the fifteenth century,
Bartholomew Diaz, a Portuguese officer of sagacity
and fortitude, prosecuted a voyage of discovery
until he arrived at the lofty promontory
which marks the southern extremity of Africa;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
being prevented by violent tempests from proceeding
farther, he called it <em>Stormy Cape</em>; but
his sovereign, entertaining the hope that this
success would lead to the discovery of the long-desired
route to the East Indies, called it <em>the
Cape of Good Hope</em>. In 1497, Emanuel, king of
Portugal, inheriting the enterprising genius of
his predecessors, sent Vasco de Gama, a man of
talent and noble birth, with three vessels, to pursue
the grand scheme of discovering a passage to
India by the Cape of Good Hope; and this officer,
surmounting the difficulties which had deterred
his predecessors, doubled that formidable promontory
which had long been the boundary of
navigation, and European ships were seen, for the
first time, navigating the Indian sea, which forms
the greatest event, next to the discovery of
America, in modern maritime history. The
route to Hindoostan was thus established; but
this important event was not immediately followed
by the formation of a settlement at the
Cape of Good Hope. Admiral Rio d’Infanté
landed there in 1498, and fixing upon the mouth
of a river for the site of a settlement, recommended
his countrymen to establish a colony
there; his advice was, however, not followed,
and other Portuguese navigators failed in some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
slight attempts which they made to colonize this
interesting part of Africa.</p>

<p>The Cape forms one of the great landmarks
of the globe, separating the Atlantic from the
Indian Ocean, and dividing the voyage to Hindoostan
into two nearly equal portions; the
ships of England and Portugal called there, and
the Dutch, in the infancy of their Indian trade,
fixed upon it as a station for their vessels to take
in water and fuel. The English had a custom, in
their outward-bound voyages, of burying letters
in an iron box, in a place pointed out by a large
blue stone, to be taken to England by the first
ship calling at the Cape in its way home.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1620</div>

<p>For more than a century the English, Dutch,
and Portuguese continued to refresh at the Cape
without appropriating the soil; but in the year
1620, in the reign of King James I., the commanders
of two fleets of English ships, bound for
Surat and Bantam, took a formal possession of the
soil, for, and in the name of their sovereign; this
was, however, not followed by the formation of
a colony there by the English.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1651</div>

<p>Van Riebeck, surgeon of a Dutch ship that
made a short stay at the Cape of Good Hope,
represented the richness of the soil, the mildness
of the climate, the advantages which a colony at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
this place would give his country over other
nations whose ships would be obliged to call there;
and, above all, the barrier it would afford to the
Indian possessions of the United Provinces; these
representations induced the Dutch East India
Company to form a regular establishment at the
Cape. Van Riebeck was furnished with power to
establish a colony, of which he was appointed
governor, and three ships, provided with all that
was necessary, were placed under his orders. On
his arrival at the Cape of Good Hope, the natives
surrendered the Cape Peninsula by treaty, with
the two bays that are divided by the isthmus, and
he erected a square fort, also warehouses, and
raised outworks and batteries. Encouragement
being given, numbers of settlers arrived from
time to time, and, by presents and promises, a
larger tract of land was procured; but when the
natives saw the colonists building houses and fortifications,
cultivating land, and breeding cattle,
a feeling of jealousy was awakened, and the Hottentots
commenced hostilities for the purpose of
expelling their visitors, which ended in the extension
of the settlements, the arrival of more
troops and colonists from Holland, and the
reduction of the natives to a state of dependence
little better than slavery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<p>The Dutch East India Company endeavoured
to limit the Cape to the original design of a port
for refreshing their ships, and they threw obstacles
in the way of its becoming a flourishing settlement;
they allowed no trade but what passed
through the hands of their own servants, and
made it dependent on the governor-general of
Batavia, concluding that the settlers would thus
be made equally submissive to their orders from
Europe, and from the seat of their wealth and
influence in the East. This illiberal policy
afforded little stimulation to industry; the settlers
became conspicuous for habits of indolence, and
education being neglected, the manners of the
colonists degenerated towards barbarism, united
with a cruel propensity to tyrannise over the
Hottentots, whose lands they had seized, and
from whom they exacted labour without due
compensation. A number of French Protestants
found an asylum at the Cape, where they introduced
the cultivation of the vine; but the colony
did not flourish under the Dutch. The natives,
however, proved a patient and submissive race;
they were the best labourers and herdsmen in
the colony, and many of them proved valuable
soldiers in the service of Holland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1794<br />1795</div>

<p>The declining commerce of the Dutch,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
towards the close of the eighteenth century, made
the Cape a burden to them; little doubt was
entertained of their willingness to part with it for
a small compensation, and overtures would, probably,
have been made from England, but at that
period the French Revolution, and its destructive
consequences, unsettled the affairs of Europe.
The favourable reception, which the doctrine of
equality met with in Holland, having disposed the
Dutch to separate from the Allies, with the result
of the campaign of 1794 in Flanders, and other
causes, occasioned the United Provinces to be
brought under the dominion of France. The
Prince of Orange fled to England, and he furnished
letters authorizing the British to take
possession of, and to hold, the colony of the Cape
of Good Hope in his name. Many of the colonists
had, in the meantime, imbibed French principles;
they had become clamorous to declare
themselves a free and independent republic; and
lists of worthy and influential persons to be consigned
to the guillotine, or banished from the
colony, for holding different views, were prepared;
at the same time the slaves, who were
much more numerous than the whites, were
holding meetings to decide upon the fate of the
free and independent burghers when the period<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
of their own emancipation should arrive. At
this important crisis the revolutionists were suddenly
disconcerted by the arrival of a British
armament under Admiral Sir G. K. Elphinstone,
and Major-General James Craig, to take possession
of the colony. The governor refused to
consign the place to the protection of the British,
and ordered the inhabitants to leave Simon’s
Town. The English were careful not to commit
any act of hostility against the Dutch; but it
being believed that the governor intended to set
fire to Simon’s Town, Major-General Craig
landed on the 14th of July, 1795, with part of
the Seventy-eighth regiment and the Marines of
the fleet, and took possession of the place, to
preserve it from destruction. Soon afterwards
the burgher militia and Hottentot soldiers, who
occupied the hills, fired on the British patroles,
and hostilities were thus commenced. The
Dutch occupied a fortified position on the rocks
of Muisenberg, from whence they were driven,
on the 7th of August, by the fire of the English
ships and the advance of the troops, and two battalions
of seamen; on this occasion the advance-guard
of the Seventy-eighth regiment drove the
enemy from a rocky ridge with great gallantry.
The Dutch fell back to Wynberg, a tongue of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
land projecting from the east side of Table mountain,
and about eight miles from Cape Town.
On the 4th of September General Alured Clarke
arrived with reinforcements, and on the 14th of
that month the British advanced and drove the
Dutch from their elevated post. Two days
afterwards the Dutch governor surrendered the
colony to the British arms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1796<br />1797</div>

<p>During the following seven years, the Cape of
Good Hope remained under the protection of the
British Government; and from this period the
origin of the <span class="smcap">Cape Mounted Riflemen</span> may be
traced. The Hottentot soldiers were not immediately
taken into the British service; but in the
years 1796 and 1797, a number of Hottentots
presented themselves at the quarters of the light
infantry brigade under Major King, of the Eighty-fourth
regiment, at the village of Stellenbosch.
They were, in the first instance, employed to cook,
and perform other menial offices for the soldiers;
but their numbers increasing, they were embodied
into a corps under Lieutenant John Campbell, of
the Ninety-eighth Foot, with a serjeant from the
same regiment. Numerous volunteers arriving,
additional officers and non-commissioned officers
were attached to them, and they were stationed in
Hout’s Bay, behind Table Mountain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1798</div>

<p>A rebellion breaking out on the frontiers of
the colony, a squadron of the Eighth Light
Dragoons, the flank companies of the regiment in
garrison, and the Cape Corps, were detached,
under Brigadier-General Vandeleur, to suppress
the insurrection, and were employed in very
arduous duties for some time. At this period,
a portion of the Cape Corps was mounted, and
employed as orderlies at head-quarters, as guides,
and for the carrying of despatches; in performing
these duties, they were found very useful.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1799<br />1800</div>

<p>In 1799, the Cape Corps was again stationed
at Hout’s Bay, with detachments at Graaff Reinett
and Algoa Bay; and, in 1800, this body of
men was formed into a regiment under Lieut.-Colonel
King, with Major Donald Campbell
second in command; the head-quarters were
established at Groen Kloof, near Cape Town,
under Major Campbell, Lieut.-Colonel King not
having joined.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1801</div>

<p>In 1801, the Cape Regiment, except the
mounted men, was sent to the frontiers, where it
was employed during the year 1802.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1802</div>

<p>At the peace of Amiens, the Cape of Good
Hope was restored to the United Provinces,
which had taken the name of the Batavian
Republic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1803</div>

<p>When the Dutch governor arrived, in the
early part of 1803, with an armament, to take
possession, the Cape Regiment was at head-quarters;
it was left in the colony, and nearly every
man was retained in the Dutch service.</p>

<p>A few months of respite from war followed
the Treaty of Amiens, and, in 1803, the contest
was renewed with a violence which, in a few years,
shook the basis of every state in Europe. During
the first three years of the war, the attention of
the British Government was directed to measures
rendered necessary by the threatened invasion of
England by Buonaparte; but in the latter months
of 1805, an armament, consisting of about five
thousand men, under the orders of Major-General
Sir David Baird<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, proceeded to recapture the settlement
of the Cape of Good Hope, with its
dependencies, then in possession of the Batavian
Government, and commanded by Lieut.-General
Janssens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1806</div>

<p>After surmounting considerable difficulties, a
landing was effected at Lospard’s Bay, on the 6th
of January, 1806; on the morning of the 8th, the
army moved in two brigades towards the road
leading to Cape Town, and attacked the enemy’s
force, consisting of five thousand men, and twenty-three
pieces of cannon, advantageously posted at
Blaw Berg, or Blue Mountains: the Dutch stood
the fire of the invading army with firmness, and
maintained their position obstinately; but the
charge of the British troops with bayonets proved
irresistible, and the enemy was forced to a precipitate
retreat.</p>

<p>A negotiation ensued between the two commanders,
which was carried on by Brigadier-General
(now Lord) Beresford: and the colony
was finally surrendered on the 18th January.</p>

<p>In the articles of capitulation it was stipulated,
that the battalion of Hottentot Light Infantry
should march to Simon’s Town, with the other Batavian
troops, after which they should be allowed
to return to their own country, or to engage in the
British Service, as they might feel inclined. A
number of them tendering their services, they were
formed into a corps at Wynberg, under the command
of Lieut.-Colonel Graham, and stationed at
that village; a detachment of about fifty men was
sent to Fort Frederick, Algoa Bay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1808</div>

<p>At the period of the surrender of the colony
to the British Crown, this regiment consisted, in
the first instance, of about five hundred rank and
file; and in 1808 it was augmented to eight
hundred. Many of the additional men were procured
by native captains, who received two shillings
a day; others were procured by recruiting
officers, and by small levies on the missionary
institutions: a number of volunteers also joined
at head-quarters.</p>

<p>At this period, one company was stationed at
Graaff Reinett, and another was sent to the frontiers
of the colony.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1809<br />1810</div>

<p>In this and the following year (1809) a company
traversed the greater part of the colony, collecting
various bodies of Kafirs<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>, and removing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
them beyond the boundary,&mdash;the Great Fish
River; this company was followed by others, and
in June, 1810, five companies were employed on
the frontiers under Major Lyster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1811<br />1812</div>

<p>The regiment embarked for Algoa Bay, in
September, 1810, and was employed, from December,
1811, until May, 1812, in removing the
Kafirs from the country between the Sunday’s
and the Great Fish Rivers. The command of
the force employed on the frontier was confided
to Lieut.-Colonel Graham, and the command of
the regiment devolved on Major Lyster.</p>

<p>A detachment crossed the Sunday’s River on
Christmas-day, 1811, under Major Prentice, and
encamped at Commando Kraal, from whence
parties were sent out to mark roads through the
Addo Bush. This work having been completed,
the men of the regiment, and some settlers, advanced
in extended order to scour the bush.
While moving towards the top of the Addo, in a
part known by the name of the “Addo Pass,” a
number of Kafirs, who had hidden themselves in
pits, jumped up and commenced throwing their
assagais, or javelins, at the troops, killing Field-Cornet
Greyling, and wounding two other farmers.
The Cape Regiment instantly rushed into the
bush, and, after a sharp skirmish, drove the
Kafirs from among the trees into the flats or
plains.</p>

<p>Landrost Stockenstrom having been murdered
while engaged in a parley with the Kafirs, relative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
to their removing from the Zuurberg, Major
Fraser marched with a detachment to execute
the orders which were to have been carried into
effect by Stockenstrom. On crossing the mountain
from Cournay he took a bye-path, and thus
escaped a body of Kafirs who were lying in ambush
to murder him and his party; and coming
upon his adversaries suddenly, he succeeded in
killing fifteen of their number; he also recovered
the bodies of Mr. Stockenstrom, two field-cornets,
and nine farmers, and buried them; and
he ascertained that several Kafirs had been shot
in the struggle, when these gentlemen were murdered.</p>

<p>At this period the Chief T’Slambie occupied
the Zuurberg with about four thousand Kafirs.</p>

<p>In May the head-quarters were established at
Graham’s Town, and, in consequence of the
hostile attitude of the Kafirs, the regiment was
distributed in small parties along the frontier, in
two lines of posts; the advanced line in detachments
from Osterhuisen’s Post, to Old Kafir
Drift; the second, from Bruintjie’s Hoogte, to
what is now called Groen Fontein; in all, about
twenty-two posts, the head-quarters remaining at
Graham’s Town.</p>

<p>Several posts in the rear line were subsequently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
abandoned, and some of the posts in the
front line were occupied by British regiments,
the Cape Regiment being found more efficient
in patrolling, scouring the bush, and dislodging
parties of Kafirs assembled within the colony.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1813<br />1814<br />1815</div>

<p>These arduous duties were performed by the
regiment in 1813, 1814, and 1815; in the last-mentioned
year Major Lyster left the frontier,
and the command of the regiment devolved on
Major Fraser.</p>

<p>In the year 1815 an extensive revolt took
place among the colonists on the frontier, and
the Cape Regiment was conspicuously useful on
this occasion; its firm and soldierlike bearing
checked the revolt; it assisted in the capture of
the insurgents; and a hundred men under Major
Fraser attended the execution of several convicted
delinquents.</p>

<p>After the suppression of this revolt, a detachment
of the regiment was selected to be attached
to the Royal Artillery as drivers; and in October,
two hundred men marched into Kafirland,
under Captain Bogle, to recover property which
had been stolen by the natives.</p>

<p>In the mean time the war had terminated in
Europe, and the sovereignty of the Cape of Good
Hope was permanently confirmed to Great
Britain by the Congress at Vienna.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1816<br />1817</div>

<p>In March, 1816, the establishment of the
Cape Regiment was fixed at ten companies of
three serjeants, two corporals, and fifty private
soldiers each; and a further reduction being
made in the strength of the British army, its
numbers were reduced, in January, 1817, to six
companies, under a major commanding.</p>

<p>During this year, detachments of the regiment
were employed night and day in patrolling
the Fish River Bush, and repelling the incursions
of the Kafirs. In March two lines of posts were
directed to be established along the frontier, and
the first line, commencing at Upper Kafir Drift
and extending up the Fish River as far as
Roode Wall, was occupied by the Cape Regiment;
at the same time the following orders were
issued for its guidance by authority and direction
of Lieutenant-General Lord Charles Henry
Somerset, then Governor of the Colony.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is to be clearly understood that no provocation
is to be given to the Kafirs in their
own territory. No cattle belonging to any
inhabitant or farmer, are, upon any account,
to be permitted to stray or graze, over to the
Kafir territory; neither is any Kafir to be
molested when within his own boundary, nor
is any soldier, or other person, permitted to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
cross the Great Fish River, except when tracing
depredations, or in the pursuit of stolen
property.</p>

<p>“It will be a primary object to capture any
Kafirs trespassing within the limits of the
colony, and his Lordship anxiously hopes that
this may be effected without bloodshed.</p>

<p>“Should cattle be traced, the party tracing
them will, if it consider itself strong enough,
and if commanded by an officer, follow until it
shall retake them.</p>

<p>“In order to encourage the men employed
upon this duty, his Lordship has directed a
reward to be given to the party making a capture,
of five rix-dollars for each Kafir, not
wounded, and one rix-dollar for each head of
cattle retaken, and for each head afterwards
restored from a Kafir Kraal, in lieu of that
which shall have been traced to it.</p>

<p>“Any Kafir who is captured is to be well
secured, and conducted from post to post to
the Drostdy at Uitenhage.”</p>
</div>

<p>In the beginning of April three hundred men
under Major Fraser accompanied the Governor,
Lord Charles Somerset, to Kafirland, where his
Lordship had an interview with the Chief Gaika,
and established friendly relations with that Chief;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
but the tribes of T’Slambie, Eno, Botman, and
Cobus Congo continued hostile to the colony.
The advantages resulting from the friendly relations
thus established, were followed by the
reduction of the regiment to two hundred men,
under Major Fraser, who assumed the command
of the frontier in October of that year. The
hostile clans continuing to make depredations,
patroles were out night and day, and on the 10th
of October three men of the Cape Regiment, the
signal men at Waay Plaats, who were returning
from the Cowie Bush, were waylaid and murdered
by the Kafirs in a manner which evinced a most
barbarous and cruel disposition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1818</div>

<p>On the 8th of January, 1818, Major Fraser
entered Kafirland with an armed force, and sixty
men of the Cape Regiment recovered twenty-one
horses and two thousand head of cattle from the
tribe of T’Slambie.</p>

<p>The Kafirs were not intimidated, but continued
their depredations, committing numerous
wanton murders, and the Cape Regiment was
constantly employed in scouring the bush, at the
same time numerous reinforcements of armed
Hottentots joined from the several institutions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1819</div>

<p>At length this border warfare began to assume
a more serious aspect, and in April, 1819,
the Kafirs under the Chiefs T’Slambie and Lynx<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
made a combined attack on Graham’s Town, but
were repulsed; on this occasion the conduct of
the Cape Regiment was conspicuous, and called
forth the approbation of Lieutenant-Colonel Willshire,
commanding the troops<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>It was found necessary to pursue these lawless
invaders into their own country, and the
Cape Regiment, consisting of two troops of
cavalry and four companies of infantry, formed
part of the force under Colonel Willshire, which
advanced into Kafirland in May, and they remained
with that force until September, when
the Kafirs were completely subdued and brought
to terms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1820<br />1821<br />1822</div>

<p>In the year 1820, a number of settlers arrived
from Great Britain, and were located about Graham’s
Town, and in the fine grass country to the
south-west of the Fish River. From this period
much improvement was produced in the character
of the Colony by the exertions and industrious
habits of the new settlers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1823</div>

<p>The duties of the frontier continued, however,
to require activity and vigilance, and in 1823
the Cape Regiment was augmented to four troops
of cavalry and four companies of infantry, in
order to check the depredations of the Kafirs.</p>

<p>In October of this year Lieut.-Colonel Fraser<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
died, and the command of the regiment devolved
on Major Henry Somerset.</p>

<p>The Regiment was actively employed in the
border warfare, and on the 4th of December
it was engaged with the tribe of the Chief
Macomo, when it recaptured many thousand
head of cattle, which had been stolen from the
farmers along the frontier.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1824<br />1825<br />1826<br />1827</div>

<p>In the years 1824, 1825, 1826, and 1827,
the regiment was constantly employed in repelling
the inroads of the Kafirs; numerous rencounters
took place, and in that period the
patroles of the regiment recovered six thousand
and twenty-nine head of cattle belonging to the
colony, which will give some idea of the nature
of this border warfare, and of the arduous duties
performed by the corps.</p>

<p>Some respite from these services being
afforded, the corps was reduced, in November,
1827, to three companies of mounted riflemen,
under a major commanding, and the head-quarters
were removed to Fort Beaufort.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1828</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Cape Mounted Riflemen</span>, under the
command of Captain Aitchison, accompanied
Lieutenant-Colonel Somerset<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> into Kafirland, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
July and August, 1828, to repel the attacks of a
horde of savages, who had driven the border
Kafirs into the colony. Lieut.-Colonel Somerset
advanced as far as the Umtata River, and on the
28th of August the <span class="smcap">Cape Mounted Riflemen</span>
were engaged with a very superior force of the
invading tribes, and after a severe action from
day-break until mid-day, the savages retreated,
leaving many women and children, and much
cattle behind them.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1829<br />1830<br />1831<br />1832<br />1833<br />1834</div>

<p>After returning from this enterprise, the
<span class="smcap">Riflemen</span> resumed their duties along the frontier;
the depredations of the Kafirs were continued,
and in the years 1828, 1829, 1830, 1831,
1832, 1833, and 1834, the patroles of the corps
recaptured six thousand two hundred and ten
head of cattle, and three hundred and thirty-four
horses, which had been stolen from the colonists.</p>

<p>Disputes frequently arose when the military
were searching for lost property; the Kafirs
denied the justice of some claims, asserted that
seizures were made without proof of guilt, and
without the tracks of the lost cattle being traced
to the kraal where a demand for cattle in lieu of
those lost was enforced. These disputes led to
bloodshed, and were followed, in 1834, by a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
simultaneous attack of the Kafirs upon the
colony at all points. On this occasion the <span class="smcap">Cape
Corps</span> had three provisional companies of mounted
men attached to it, and having taken the field, it
was almost constantly engaged in detached parties
with the invaders. It penetrated into Kafirland,
and was employed in the most active and
arduous services under Lieut.-Colonel Somerset,
and Major Burney, for many months.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1835<br />1836<br />1837</div>

<p>The Kafir war was continued in 1835, and in
May of that year the head-quarters of the corps
were removed to Cypher Fontein; strong detachments
being employed in the new province,
and along the line of posts. The corps was also
actively employed on the frontier during the
subsequent years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1838</div>

<p>In February, 1838, some of the provisional
recruits, stationed at Fort Peddie, laid the foundation
of a serious mutiny, which was fortunately
discovered by some old soldiers of the corps,
and immediately reported to Captain Murray of
the Seventy-second Highlanders, commanding
the post, and the ringleaders were secured. A
party of these men having marched to Fraser’s
camp, on route to head-quarters, they fired upon
their officers in the night, when Ensign Crowe, a
provisional officer, was killed. This alarming
circumstance appeared to endanger the character<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
of the corps; but the investigation instituted by
Major-General Sir George Napier, and the proceedings
of the general court-martial on the trial
of the ringleaders, clearly proved, that no blame
was to be attached to the officers, nor to the
established members of the corps: in August,
his Excellency the Governor was pleased to recommend
a permanent augmentation of three
companies to the corps.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1839</div>

<p>The augmentation of the corps was carried into
effect in March, 1839, when the six companies of
the <span class="smcap">Cape Mounted Riflemen</span> were placed under
the command of Colonel Henry Somerset: their
head-quarters had been removed in the previous
November, from Cypher Fontein to Graham’s
Town, from which period they have been actively
employed along the frontier, occupying seventeen
posts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1840</div>

<p>In October, 1840, his Excellency Major-General
Sir George Napier inspected the corps,
and afterwards, addressing the officers and soldiers,
expressed his unqualified approbation of
their conduct since he quitted the frontier in
1838, and of their efficiency in every respect.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <span class="smcap">Cape of Good Hope</span>, where the services
of the <span class="smcap">Cape Mounted Riflemen</span> have been of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
signal advantage to the settlers, forms an interesting
and important portion of the British dominions,
and is capable of becoming a particularly
valuable colony. On approaching this part of
Africa, the immense mass of naked rock called
Table Mountain, rising to the height of three
thousand five hundred feet, with its summit
covered with a fleecy canopy of clouds, forms a
conspicuous object; and on a plain, sloping downwards
from the mountain, stands Cape Town, the
capital of the colony, which is defended by a
castle of considerable strength.</p>

<p>The colony is bounded on the west and
south, by the Atlantic and Southern oceans; on
the east, by the Great Fish River, which separates
it from Kafirland, or Caffraria; on the north
by a vast chain of mountains which form a barrier
between it and the Bechuanas and other
independent tribes that stretch into the interior.
The colony is between five and six hundred miles
long, and its breadth varies from two to three
hundred miles; it contains about one hundred
and twenty thousand square miles. The leading
features consist of three successive ranges of
mountains, running parallel with each other to
the southern coast of Africa. Between the first
range (called Lang Kloof, or Long Pass) and the
sea, there is a belt of land varying from twenty to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
sixty miles in breadth, covered with a deep fertile
soil, watered by numerous rivulets, well clothed
with grass and a beautiful variety of trees and
shrubs, and yielding an abundance of grain and
pasturage. Between this range and the second,
called Zwarte Berg, or Black Mountain, there is
another belt of land of about the same average
breadth, but of greater elevation, and containing
patches of fertile land interspersed in large
tracts of arid desert; on these spots are a
number of grazing farms, which produce fine
horses and horned cattle. Beyond the Black
Mountain, at an interval from eighty to a
hundred miles of elevated ground of a barren
character, rises the highest range of mountains in
Southern Africa, called Nieuwveldt Gebrige, the
summits of which are generally covered with
snow. In this extensive territory, forming, as it
were, a succession of terraces rising above each
other, much barren land exists, interspersed with
many spots of extreme fertility, producing, in
their wild state, plants and flowers distinguished
by the elegance of their forms and colours. The
colony is capable of much improvement, and of
maintaining a much larger population than that
by which it is occupied. The principal of the
rural occupants are wine-growers, corn-farmers
and graziers; the first reside in the immediate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
vicinity of the Cape; they produce wine of ten or
twelve different kinds, and that called Constantia,
has obtained considerable reputation; brandy also
forms a staple product among them, but both
articles admit of improvement. The corn-farmers
reside, generally, a few days’ journey from
the Cape, and the fertility of the soil enables
them to reap good crops of wheat, barley, rye,
maize, peas, beans, and on some occasions they
bring quantities of aloes to the Cape, for which
they obtain a good price. The graziers occupy
the more remote districts of the colony, and have
large flocks of sheep, some of them remarkable
for immense tails; this breed is, however, gradually
becoming extinct; the Saxon, Merino and
other fine-wool breeds having been introduced
with great advantage; the graziers have also
great quantities of horned cattle. Fruits of various
kinds are produced on the west coast of the
colony in as great perfection as in any part of
the globe. The Hottentots are the chief labourers
of the colony, and are a patient submissive race;
when trained as soldiers they prove an useful and
efficient class of men.</p>

<p>Extensive measures have been adopted to
diffuse the advantages of civilization, and the
blessings of Christianity among the tribes of this
part of Africa; schools have been introduced,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
and missionary stations formed, and the results
have been most favourable to the progress of
humanity. In this respect the colony offers a
field for the efforts of philanthropy of a most
interesting character.</p>

<p>The geographical position of the <span class="smcap">Cape of
Good Hope</span> points out the importance of this
colony in a commercial and military point of view;
situate half-way between England and India, in a
wholesome climate, and producing refreshments
of every description, it is capable of becoming
a particularly valuable post. In the event of a
war, the power which holds the Cape may be
said to possess the key of India. It is capable
of becoming a valuable station for naval and
military establishments to give effectual security
to the Indian trade and settlements. It might,
also, be rendered particularly advantageous to the
interests of the British empire as an emporium of
Eastern produce, and as furnishing articles of
export for consumption in Europe and the West
Indies. The advantage of its position, considered
in connection with the intercourse of Europe
with the vast regions situate around the
Indian Ocean, and its convenient situation as a
place of refreshment for vessels navigating to and
from the East Indies, are quite obvious.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1841</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Cape Mounted Riflemen</span> are intimately
connected with the several interesting and important
points in which the Cape of Good Hope
may be viewed, in relation to the advantages
accruing to Great Britain from the possession of
this colony. During the whole of the services of
the corps from 1806 to 1841 it has enjoyed, and
frequently received, the expressed approbation of
the several Commanders-in-Chief of the colony,
for its conduct, discipline, and arduous exertions
for the service of the Crown. Among the officers
who have signalized themselves, the names of
<em>Colonels</em> John Graham and Henry Somerset;
<em>Lieut.-Colonels</em> Thomas Lyster and G. Sackville
Fraser; <em>Major</em> Robert S. Aitchison, and <em>Captain</em>
William W. Harding, deserve to be particularly
mentioned; also, <em>Lieutenant</em> and <em>Adjutant</em> Robert
Hart, who served from 1808 to 1817, when he was
appointed to a responsible situation under the Colonial
Government; and <em>Lieutenant</em> and <em>Adjutant</em>
John Blakeway, who served from 1819 to 1827.
Many of the present members of the corps have
shared in all its arduous duties for several years.</p>

<p>In testimony of the high sense entertained
by Her Majesty Queen Victoria of the efficient
services of the <span class="smcap">Cape Mounted Riflemen</span>, Her
Majesty has recently directed that a pair of
Standards, or Guidons, shall be presented to that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
Corps. The First, or Royal Standard, is of
crimson silk; in the centre of which are conjoined
the rose, shamrock, and thistle; in a scroll
beneath is the Royal motto, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dieu et mon
droit</i>;” the whole surmounted by the imperial
crown; the White Horse on a red ground in a
compartment in the first and fourth corners, and
the words “<em>Cape Mounted Riflemen</em>,” on a green
ground in the second and third corners. In the
middle of the Second, or Regimental Standard, is
the title of the Corps encircled by the national
emblems of the United Kingdom; above is the
imperial crown; and in a scroll beneath the
words “<em>Cape of Good Hope</em>” in the first and
fourth corners the White Horse on a red ground,
and in the second and third corners the rose,
shamrock, and thistle; the field of this Standard
is green; the ground of the four badges is crimson.</p>

<p>So gratifying a mark of the Sovereign’s approval
cannot fail to prove acceptable both to the
officers and men of this useful and efficient corps,
and to afford an encouragement to their future
exertions and good conduct.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> The <em>Kafirs</em> are natives of <em>Caffraria</em>, <em>Caffreland</em>, or, more
properly, “<em>Kafirland</em>,” from the Arabic word <em>Kafir</em>, which signifies
“Unbeliever;” these people are a hardy and warlike race;
they are armed with light spears, about seven feet in length,
called <em>assagais</em>, of which each warrior carries six or eight, and a
kind of club for close fighting, called a kerrie; the former they
throw with great force and dexterity, seldom missing an object at
a less distance than sixty paces. The men are, for the most part,
tall, muscular, robust, and very active, and from the difficult, and
almost inaccessible nature of the country in which the troops have
to act against them, are far from being a despicable enemy: they
have of late years obtained guns and an abundance of horses; they
seldom make an attack in the open field, but select, with much
judgment, the most rugged and rocky ravines, and the densest
thickets, for their onset. They are patient of hunger and fatigue;
and traverse immense distances in an incredibly short space of
time, and the features of the country being favourable to their
mode of warfare, military combination is rendered extremely difficult;
the greatest caution and steadiness are, therefore, requisite
in troops employed in any operation, in order to guard against a
surprise from so wily and active a people, who are watchful of
every opportunity to pounce upon any detachment which may
appear to be unsupported, or neglectful of the necessary precautions
against surprise.</p>

<p>A most able and experienced officer (Colonel H. G. Smith, late
of the Rifle Brigade, and Deputy Quarter-Master-General at the
Cape of Good Hope) declared, “that to follow the enemy vigorously
to his haunts and lurking-places, requires a perfect knowledge
of the service in all its branches, and an intrepidity and
recklessness of danger, which, while they become the soldier, prove
the courage of the man.”</p>

<p>Although the Kafirs occupy a fertile territory, which is capable
of great improvement, yet it is found, even at the present
period, that the habits and propensities of the male population are
more suited to depredation and warfare, than to the peaceful pursuits
of agriculture, the females being employed in all the offices
of labour; their frequent incursions on the lands and property of
the settlers on the British frontier; their constant state of preparation
for aggression and acts of hostility, and the treacherous and,
in some instances, barbarous practices to which they have recourse,
prove them to be very dangerous neighbours; and until civilization,
and the principles of Christianity shall have been diffused in
that very extensive territory, it may be apprehended that these
people will continue their ravages, particularly if the corps on the
frontier should be reduced, or should relax in their responsible
duties for the protection of the colony.</p>

<p>Hence the importance of an active and well-disciplined body of
troops on the frontier, in which the confidence of the Government
can be placed, and which are prepared, on every occasion, to defend
the property of the settlers, and to follow up any acts of aggression
on the part of their predatory neighbours.</p>

devotional frame of mind, presupposed on the part of the reader, in this species of composition;
but he has not deemed it as necessary to preserve with strictness the conventional style of the
pulpit, for which these discourses were never intended: they may, consequently, be taken as
a series of Essays, or as the successive chapters of a general work.</p>

<span class="fs60"><em>ARRANGED AS SOLOS, AND CONCERTED PIECES, FOR PRIVATE PERFORMANCE,<br />
WITH ACCOMPANIMENTS FOR THE PIANO-FORTE.</em></span></p>

<p class="blockq">The exclusive nature of nearly all existing collections of Sacred Music, and the high price at
which novelties are in general produced, renders this work particularly desirable. Many fine
productions, at present comparatively unknown, would be hailed with delight as additions to the
stores of Sacred Harmony, could they be procured in a familiar form and on reasonable terms.</p>

<p class="blockq">&nbsp;&nbsp; The design of the present work, therefore, is to place within the reach of families, and of persons
unaccustomed to playing from score, really good practical music; classical, yet not laboriously
and uselessly learned; to introduce into the drawing-room many beautiful compositions of enduring
value, which, if not altogether unknown, have rarely been heard except at Concerts or
Oratorios; and thus to attract towards Sacred Music a portion of that patronage which is bestowed,
in so disproportionate a degree, upon works of a secular kind.</p>

<p class="blockq">&nbsp;&nbsp; Prefixed to each Volume are Biographical Sketches of the Authors whose compositions it contains,
together with Historical and Critical Accounts of the Works upon which their respective
reputations are principally founded.</p>

<p class="blockqx lht">The design of this work is, to present, on a scale and in a manner
adapted to general appreciation, an estimate of the literary character
and monuments of our venerable Church. The moral excellences, the
religious principles, and the learned labours of her more distinguished
Divines, as exhibited in their lives, and exemplified by entire treatises,
or considerable portions, selected from their writings, will constitute
the chief materials of the design; but connected and bound together
as a continuous work, by a broad view of English Church History.
Thus the general, and especially the youthful reader will be furnished,
in these volumes, with a knowledge, sufficient for his purpose, of what
as Englishmen we owe to the National Church, and to those gifted
and energetic minds who have zealously laboured in her service for the
honour of God and the good of mankind; while others, who, from
professional duty, or a serious literary taste, intend to devote themselves
systematically to the study of that unequalled treasure of
thought, erudition, and eloquence,&mdash;the Theological Literature of
England,&mdash;will be prepared by the previous perusal of these volumes
for more profound and extensive research.</p>

<p class="blockq">The Illustration of the Holy Scriptures must ever be an object of paramount importance to
every devout Christian. In this work, the varied stores of information which have been accumulating
for ages, relating to the civil and ecclesiastical history of ancient empires, and the
interesting and valuable researches of modern travellers, particularly those relating to Egypt,
are examined, and the results placed before the reader.</p>

<p class="blockq">&nbsp;&nbsp; In duly estimating <ins class="corr" id="tn-C15" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'he importance of'">
the importance of</ins> critical and philological research, and in clearing
away some of the obscurities of the Scriptures, the Editor considers the Bible, in its structure,
spirit, and character, to be essentially an Eastern book. The natural phenomena, and moral condition
of the East, should therefore be made largely tributary to its elucidation. For this important
purpose, the Editor draws largely from those rich and abundant stores unfolded by the
spirit of modern enterprise.</p>

<p class="blockq">&nbsp;&nbsp; The Editor most anxiously avoids that spirit of error which has, unhappily, too much prevailed
of late on the Continent, and which, by arrogating to itself the claims of superior sagacity
and learning, has sought to reduce everything in the Sacred Volume to the level of its own
limited views and narrow conceptions, denying or explaining away the miracles, and seeking
thereby to lower our reverence for the word of God, and for divine things in general. Such
views and principles, usually classed under the term <em>Neology</em>, receive no countenance in the pages
of this work. The <span class="smcap">Bible</span> is, throughout, exhibited as Scripture given by inspiration of God, and
not as mere human composition.</p>

<p class="blockq">&nbsp;&nbsp; Scripture Biography is treated of in a brief and concise manner, except when difficulties
occur which require to be cleared up; and the topographical descriptions of remarkable places of
Scripture form a marked feature in the <span class="smcap">Bible Cyclopædia</span>.</p>

<p class="blockq">&nbsp;&nbsp; Numerous Wood-Cuts are given of Coins, Medals, Gems, remarkable Places, and other
subjects capable of legitimate illustration, from the best and most recent sources of information.</p>

<span class="fs70">HISTORICAL AND DESCRIPTIVE ATLAS OF SCRIPTURE<br />
GEOGRAPHY.<br />
By WILLIAM HUGHES, F.R.G.S.</span></p>

<p class="blockq">The numerous attempts successively made to illustrate the geography of the Bible have
been, in too many instances, based upon mere <em>conjectures</em>, sometimes supported only by vague
etymological analogies drawn from the writings of Greek and Roman antiquity, and often only
showing how little the framers of them really <em>knew</em> of Palestine, but which have, in almost all
cases, been disproved by the appliance of modern observation. This would have been of comparatively
little importance if, as new facts were acquired, they had been constantly made use
of, and applied as tests of the worth of preconceived hypotheses. But it has unfortunately happened
that, either from the ignorance or carelessness of the greater number of the compilers of
<em>Scripture Atlases</em>, a large amount of real and available information has either not yet been
applied to the illustration of the Geography of the Sacred Volume, or else it has been mixed up
with long-received conjectures, in such a manner as to make the ascertained <em>truths</em> subservient
to the hypotheses, instead of confirming or rejecting the latter, according as it corresponded or
not with the former. The result has, of course, been to confuse rather than elucidate the subject;
and the great majority of the Maps professing to illustrate the Bible, mostly copied from others
of a similar description, and inheriting in succession the absurdities and puerile conjectures of
former times, present, accordingly, a mass of confusion, in which it is impossible for the inexperienced
student to separate the true from the false, or the known from the conjectural.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
